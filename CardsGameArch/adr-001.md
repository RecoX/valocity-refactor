# [ADR 1] - [Scaffolding Cards Game]

Date: 01/12/2023

## Context
The CardsGame project aims to create a card game application.

## Decision
It was decided to set up our development environment using three abstraction of projects Core, Tests and ConsoleApp.
This is an starting point for the development of our Team members, now they can collaborate effectively, and we have a functional base to build upon. Further features, game rules, and enhancements can be added in subsequent pull requests.

## Consequences
Development environment setup will provide a stable and familiar environment for the development team.
The solution structure separates concerns, making the codebase more organized and maintainable.
Implementing a CI/CD pipeline will be possible to increase code quality and accelerate the release process.
