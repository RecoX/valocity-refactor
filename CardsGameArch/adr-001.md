## Context
The CardsGame project aims to create a card game application.

## Decision
It was decided to set up our development environment using three abstraction of projects Core, Tests and ConsoleApp.

## Consequences
Development environment setup will provide a stable and familiar environment for the development team.
The solution structure separates concerns, making the codebase more organized and maintainable.
Implementing a CI/CD pipeline will be possible to increase code quality and accelerate the release process.
